# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

# Update

I have further refactored my code to use form and radio buttons. I still have more I would like to do but it's working better and much cleaner.

## Overview

- I started this one before joining frontend mentor. After I joined I then broke it and redid it using the matching color scheme and matching .svg
  My javascript I noticed a bug that as soon as I click on a number my hover quits working. I'm still new to javascript so I'm guessing my hover is getting overridden by my code. Also, I was trying to learn how to use the dataset and notice that everything is getting put in the div even though I only assigned it one time per loop. Haven't figured out why the color attributes are getting added. Being a beginner project I'm sure I am probably overdoing it using the dataset.
